# Wide Post Mass Transfer Binaries

## Yamaguchi 2023 Paper

### 1. Introduction

- IK Peg, period 22d, unusually large WD, extra energy
- Several WD + MS system candidate of wide PCEB
- In this paper, five examples of solar-type MS and ultramassive WD

### 6. Feasibility of formation through CEE

initial conditions for simulation in introduction part

simulation / calculation results in figure

simulation for $7\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and $1 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ giant results

### 7. Discussion

*Questions*

- critical mass ratio where MT is unstable?



## Belloni 2024 Paper

Same question about critical mass ratio for stable MT

Grid of binaries, simulation results in $M-P$​​​ plane.

*Questions*

- maximum orbit period functino of WD mass, theoretical / experiement?
- Gap at 0.5M in figure 1?
- large period — CEE onset occurs when donor is TP-AGB, why?



## Research Idea

Formation of WD binaries

Formation process: 

MS + MS --> Massive star fill Roche Lobe --> Stable accretion / Unstable mass transfer with CE

--> Kinda close binary / very close binary

Expectation: short period WD + MS with period < 10 days

What we found: longer period ~ 60 - hundreds of days

Question:

- Separation too wide, period too short -- Not enough energy liberated to unbind/eject CE -- then how the star form?
- CE parameters? High $\alpha$ (CE efficiency)​? Extra energy source other than thermodynamic internal? Projenitor of WD?
- How to make longer period WD + MS binaries through stable & unstable mass transfer?

Method:

- Run COSMIC simulation for different mass transfer assumptions
- Dig into orbital dynamics
- Theory & code development
