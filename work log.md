# Mass Transfer Project Work Log

## 05/28/2024 – Tuesday

- Finished simulation for same setup in yamaguchi paper
- Fit MESA lambda for both high mass (7+1) and low mass (1.5+1) systems
- Started simulations for stable mass transfer, plan to study $a_f$ versus $a_i$.

## 05/09/2024 — Thursday

First day of research

- Finished reading Yamaguchi and Bolleni paper
- Try to replicate simulation results in paper tomorrow, Yamaguchi first

## 05/08/2024 — Wednesday

First meeting, start of summer research

*Goals*

- Yamaguchi paper, read scetion 1, and 5 throught the end
- Try pull out initial conditions, run and try to replicate with cosmic
- Try to replicate simluatinos of individual systems, compare results
- Belloni paper, read all, try replicate

## 03/10/2024 — Sunday

*Research preparation*

- Finish software carpenter — python data processing and plotting
- Working on COSMIC baiscs — playing with single binary simulation

*Plans*

- Try to understand binary evolution in COSMIC
- Read relevant chapter (evolution on/after MS) in Carroll book
- Continue Nutshell, get familiar with mechanics



## 03/02/2024 — Saturday

First day of spring break

*Research preparation*

- Begin software carpenter — python data processing and plotting
- Begin COSMIC simulation — learn to simulate single and multiple binaries
- Continue Nutshell — combine with COSMIC result, learn about mechanics
- Carroll astrophysics — learn about stars, make additional plots

*SURF Application*

- Finished SRUF Application



## 01/23/2024 — Tuesday

*SURF Application Plan*

- Start to write research proposal. Several bullet points for each needed items
- Check proposal writing workshop slides for guides
- Notes on methodology
  - (introduce Cosmic and run simulation, other details)
  - Read paper, code documentation / introduction
- Notes on feedback and evaluation
  - Check weekly, mid-summer check

*Research Preparation*

- Read *Stellar Evolution in a Nutshell*, derive equations
- Play around with COSMIC simulation, get familiar
- Send message to update and schedule next meeting before end of week
